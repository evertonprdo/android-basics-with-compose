# Flight Search

In this project, you'll build the Flight Search app in which users enter an airport and can view a list of destinations using that airport as a departure. This project gives you the opportunity to practice your skills with SQL, Room, and DataStore by offering you a set of app requirements that you must fulfill. In particular, you need the Flight Search app to meet the following requirements:

- [ ] Provide a text field for the user to enter an airport name or International Air Transport Association (IATA) airport identifier.
- [ ] Query the database to provide autocomplete suggestions as the user types.
- [ ] When the user chooses a suggestion, generate a list of available flights from that airport, including the IATA identifier and airport name to other airports in the database.
- [ ] Let the user save favorite individual routes.
- [ ] When no search query is entered, display all the user-selected favorite routes in a list.
- [ ] Save the search text with Preferences DataStore. When the user reopens the app, the search text, if any, needs to prepopulate the text field with appropriate results from the database.
