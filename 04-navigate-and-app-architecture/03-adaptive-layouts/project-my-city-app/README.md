2. Overview

To help reinforce what you learned in this unit, you will build an app that contains lists of recommendations for different activities and places to visit within a city of your choice.

This app should:

-  [x] Contain multiple screens; for example, each screen can display a different category of recommendations.
-  [x] Use the Jetpack Navigation component to enable users to navigate through your app.
-  [x] Maintain a clear distinction between the UI layer and the data layer.
-  [x] Use a ViewModel and make updates to the UI from the view model using the unidirectional data flow (UDF) pattern.
-  [x] Use adaptive layouts that account for all different screen sizes.
-  [x] Follow Material Design guidelines for adaptive design and navigation.

note: Cornélio Procópio, PR - is a city close to where I live
